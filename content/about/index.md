Hello World! I'm Vedang. I'm a software engineer by day and a cinephile by night. I am working with Persistent on IBM's Power8 platform for the Open-Source community. I believe I have decent experience in Data Science, which I garnered during my internship at Sirpi, a Bangalore based start-up. Prior to that, I interned at a FinTech start-up RhythmFlows where I lead a small team for an Analytics and a Bank Reconciliation project.

I'm a huge fan of the open-source community and I have self-hosted my own movie, photo and cloud server (All of that for FREE!). Drop in a message if you want to know how.

Other than coding(most of which is debugging), I love to play Piano.

Here are some my favourite movies and the techologies which I have worked on. I'll leave it up to you to figure out which is which, so good luck:
