I'm a software engineer by day and a cinephile, comic and manga aficionado by night. When I'm not coding or reading manga I love to spend my time competing in multiplayer esports with my friends. I love working on new projects that will challenge my abilities and broaden my horizon to new and interesting technologies. I have worked with Blockchain where I deployed a private blockchain with consensus algorithm. I am familiar with Hyperledger Fabric and have experience in python based Blockchain projects. I am interested in Data Sciece and have undertaken multiple project for learning purposes.

I'm a huge fan of the open-source community and I have self-hosted my own cloud server on a VPS. 

Other than coding(most of which includes debugging), I love to play Piano and Classical Keyboard.
